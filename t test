#you typically have the following two hypotheses:
 #Null hypotheses: Two group means are equal
 #Alternative hypotheses: Two group means are different (two-tailed)
    

#importing data

import pandas as pd
data = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/baskaufs/1a7a995c1b25d6e88b45/raw/4bb17ccc5c1e62c27627833a4f25380f27d30b35/t-test.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data)
df.head()

# Subset data
male = df.query('grouping == "men"')['height']
female = df.query('grouping == "women"')['height']

#Leveneâ€™s test to test for homogeneity of variances (equal variances)
stats.levene(male, female)
# Output: LeveneResult(statistic=0.026695150465104206, pvalue=0.8729335280501348)
#the p-value suggests that the data follows the assumption of equal variances

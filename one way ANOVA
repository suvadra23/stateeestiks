#One-Way ANOVA
#also known as “analysis of variance” 
#is a test that is used to find out whether there exists a statistically significant difference between the mean values of more than one group.

#statement
#Researchers took 20 cars of the same to take part in a study. 
#These cars are randomly doped with one of the four-engine oils and allowed to run freely for 100 kilometers each. 
#At the end of the journey, the performance of each of the cars is noted. 

# Importing library
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
 
 
# Performance when each of the engine
# oil is applied
performance1 = [89, 89, 88, 78, 79]
performance2 = [93, 92, 94, 89, 88]
performance3 = [89, 88, 89, 93, 90]
performance4 = [81, 78, 81, 92, 82]
 
# Conduct the one-way ANOVA
f_oneway(performance1, performance2, performance3, performance4)

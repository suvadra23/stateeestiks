Two Sample Z-Test in Python
Suppose the IQ levels among individuals in two different cities are known to be normally distributed with known standard deviations.
A researcher wants to know if the mean IQ level between individuals in city A and city B are different, 
so she selects a simple random sample of  20 individuals from each city and records their IQ levels.

The following code shows how to perform a two sample z-test in Python to determine if the mean IQ level is different between the two cities:

from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ztest as ztest

#enter IQ levels for 20 individuals from each city
cityA = [82, 84, 85, 89, 91, 91, 92, 94, 99, 99,
         105, 109, 109, 109, 110, 112, 112, 113, 114, 114]

cityB = [90, 91, 91, 91, 95, 95, 99, 99, 108, 109,
         109, 114, 115, 116, 117, 117, 128, 129, 130, 133]

#perform two sample z-test
ztest(cityA, cityB, value=0) 

output
(-1.9953236073282115, 0.046007596761332065)

The test statistic for the two sample z-test is -1.9953 and the corresponding p-value is 0.0460.
Since this p-value is less than .05, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 
In other words, the mean IQ level is significantly different between the two cities.

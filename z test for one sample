#Suppose the IQ in a certain population is normally distributed with a mean of μ = 100 and standard deviation of σ = 15.
#A researcher wants to know if a new drug affects IQ levels, so he recruits 20 patients to try it and records their IQ levels.
#The following code shows how to perform a one sample z-test in Python to determine if the new drug causes a significant difference in IQ levels:

from statsmodels.stats.weightstats 
import ztest as ztest

#enter IQ levels for 20 patients
data = [88, 92, 94, 94, 96, 97, 97, 97, 99, 99,
        105, 109, 109, 109, 110, 112, 112, 113, 114, 115]

#perform one sample z-test
ztest(data, value=100)

#output (1.5976240527147705, 0.1101266701438426)

#The test statistic for the one sample z-test is 1.5976 and the corresponding p-value is 0.1101.
#Since this p-value is not less than .05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 
#In other words, the new drug does not significantly affect IQ level.

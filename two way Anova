#Let us consider an example in which scientists need to know whether plant growth is affected by fertilizers and watering frequency. 
#They planted exactly 30 plants and allowed them to grow for six months under different conditions for fertilizers and watering frequency.
#After exactly six months, they recorded the heights of each plant centimeters.

# Importing libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

# Create a dataframe
dataframe = pd.DataFrame({'Fertilizer': np.repeat(['daily', 'weekly'], 15),
                          'Watering': np.repeat(['daily', 'weekly'], 15),
                          'height': [14, 16, 15, 15, 16, 13, 12, 11, 14, 
                                     15, 16, 16, 17, 18, 14, 13, 14, 14,

 # Performing two-way ANOVA
model = ols('height ~ C(Fertilizer) + C(Watering) +\C(Fertilizer):C(Watering)',
            data=dataframe).fit()
